# Pop! The Question!
## Work in progress

A simple full-stack polling app viewable [here](pop-the-question.herokuapp.com).

Built with the Heroku-CRA-Node boilerplate to run the React front end and Express
back end on one server.  Not necessary for an app like this that doesn't provide any endpoints to external sources, but I wanted to try it.

## Tools Used:

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Passport.js
- React
- React-Router
- React-Bootstrap

## TODO:

- Add graphical representation of voting
- Format poll page
- Refactor API to ensure idempotence
- Split API code for modularity
